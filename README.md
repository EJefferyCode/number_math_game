Two versions of a mathematical probability guessing game. 

<h1>Guess That Number Probability Game!</h1>

<p>This is a simple, yet <b>highly</b> addictive game that can teach one about the algorithms of mathematics and numbers.
I designed this game to have two versions: an "easy" version and a "harder" version. The easy version simply allows a user to 
choose a completely computer-selected number between 1-100. They have ten tries before they fail.</p>

<p>The harder version was purposely designed to get the user to think about numbers as groups, and the probability that a
number from a given group will be chosen. I created an array of numbers that are multiples of 10 from 10-100, as well as a 
randomly chosen number between the groups. For examply, for every 10 numbers, a random non multiple of 10 could also be counted
as an answer. The user has 6 tries to guess what number is chosen, and they are given hints as to whether their choice was 
'too high' or, 'too low', allowing them to narrow.</p>

I hope you find this game and code interesting. Feel free to leave feedback. Thanks,
